## 1. Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel.

### Key Features:
- Distributed development
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
- Able to handle large projects efficiently
- Cryptographic authentication of history
- Toolkit-based design
- Pluggable merge strategies
- Garbage accumulates until collection

## 2. Git's Core Philosophy

Git's design is based on a few core principles:

### Snapshots, Not Differences
Unlike other VCS systems that store data as changes to a base version of each file, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem.

### Nearly Every Operation Is Local
Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate, generally no information is needed from another computer on your network.

### Git Has Integrity
Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA-1 hash.

### Git Generally Only Adds Data
When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It's hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way.

### The Three States
Git has three main states that your files can reside in:
1. Modified: You have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
2. Staged: You have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
3. Committed: The data is safely stored in your local database.

## 3. Git Internals: What's Under the Hood

Understanding Git's internals helps in grasping its operations better.

### Objects
Git's object database contains four types of objects:
1. Blob: Stores file data
2. Tree: Represents a directory structure
3. Commit: Represents a specific point in the project's history
4. Tag: Marks a specific commit as special (usually for release versions)

### References
References are pointers to commits. They include:
- Branches: Mutable pointers to commits
- Tags: Immutable pointers to commits
- HEAD: A pointer to the current branch

### The Index (Staging Area)
The index is a binary file in the `.git` directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit.

### How Git Stores Objects
Git uses a content-addressable filesystem. It means that the content of a file determines its name in Git's internal storage.

1. Git generates a hash of the content.
2. It creates a directory named with the first two characters of the hash.
3. It stores the object in a file named with the remaining characters of the hash.

For example, if the hash is "ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a", Git will create a directory "ce" and store the object in a file named "013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a".

## 4. Setting Up Git

### Installation
- On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git`
- On macOS with Homebrew: `brew install git`
- On Windows: Download from git-scm.com

### Configuration
Set your name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Set your default editor:
```bash
git config --global core.editor "vim"  # or nano, emacs, etc.
```

Set default branch name:
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## 5. Basic Git Operations

### Initializing a Repository
```bash
git init
```

### Cloning a Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Checking Status
```bash
git status
```

### Staging Changes
```bash
git add <file>          # Stage specific file
git add .               # Stage all changes in current directory
git add -p              # Interactively choose hunks of patch to stage
git add -u              # Stage all tracked files (excluding untracked)
git add -A              # Stage all changes (including untracked)
```

### Committing Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
git commit -a -m "Commit message"  # Stage all tracked files and commit
```

### Viewing History
```bash
git log
git log --oneline       # Compact view
git log --graph --all   # Show branch structure
```

### Showing Changes
```bash
git diff                # Show unstaged changes
git diff --staged       # Show staged changes
```

### Removing Files
```bash
git rm <file>           # Remove file from working directory and staging area
git rm --cached <file>  # Remove file from staging area only
```

### Renaming Files
```bash
git mv <old-name> <new-name>
```
This is equivalent to:
```bash
mv <old-name> <new-name>
git rm <old-name>
git add <new-name>
```

## 6. Advanced Git Operations

### Branching
Create a new branch:
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

Switch to a branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Create and switch in one command:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

List branches:
```bash
git branch          # Local branches
git branch -r       # Remote branches
git branch -a       # All branches
```

Delete a branch:
```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>    # Safe delete
git branch -D <branch-name>    # Force delete
```

### Merging
```bash
git checkout main
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Rebasing
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It's a way to integrate changes from one branch into another.

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

This moves the entire `feature` branch to begin on the tip of the `main` branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in `main`. Instead of using a merge commit, rebasing rewrites the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.

#### When to Use Rebase:
- To maintain a linear project history
- When working on a feature branch that needs to incorporate latest changes from main
- Before submitting a pull request

#### Cautions:
- Never rebase commits that have been pushed to public repositories
- Rebasing can potentially lose commits if not done carefully

### Interactive Rebase
Interactive rebasing allows you to alter commits as they are moved to the new base. You can reorder, edit, squash, or drop commits.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Interactively rebase the last 3 commits
```

This opens an editor where you can choose actions for each commit:

- `pick`: use the commit as is
- `reword`: use the commit, but edit the commit message
- `edit`: use commit, but stop for amending
- `squash`: use commit, but meld into previous commit
- `fixup`: like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
- `drop`: remove commit

### Cherry-Picking
Cherry-picking in Git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

This is useful when you want to apply a specific change but not the entire branch.

## 7. Branching Strategies

### Feature Branch Workflow
- Create a new branch for each feature
- Merge back to main when complete

### Gitflow Workflow
- `main` branch for releases
- `develop` branch as an integration branch
- Feature branches off of `develop`
- Release branches for preparing new production releases
- Hotfix branches for critical bugs in production

### GitHub Flow
- Anything in the `main` branch is deployable
- Create descriptively named branches off of main
- Push to named branches constantly
- Open a pull request at any time
- Merge only after pull request review

### Trunk-Based Development
- Developers collaborate on code in a single branch called 'trunk'
- Resists any pressure to create other long-lived development branches
- Relies heavily on feature toggles and robust testing

## 8. Collaboration with Remote Repositories

### Adding a Remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Fetching from Remote
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### Pulling from Remote
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Pushing to Remote
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Working with Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a feature branch
4. Make changes and commit
5. Push the branch to your fork
6. Create a pull request on GitHub

## 9. Submodules and Subtrees

### Submodules
Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

#### Adding a Submodule
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git path/to/submodule
```

#### Cloning a Project with Submodules
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

#### Updating Submodules
```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

### Subtrees
Git subtrees allow you to insert any repository as a sub-directory of another one.

#### Adding a Subtree
```bash
git subtree add --prefix=<prefix> <repository-url> <ref> --squash
```

#### Updating a Subtree
```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=<prefix> <repository-url> <ref> --squash
```

## 10. Rewriting History

### Amending the Last Commit
```bash
git commit --amend
```

### Reordering Commits
Use interactive rebase:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
Then, in the editor, change the order of the lines.

### Squashing Commits
Again, use interactive rebase and change `pick` to `squash` for the commits you want to combine.

### Splitting a Commit
1. Start an interactive rebase
2. Mark the commit you want to split as `edit`
3. When Git pauses at that commit:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD^
   git add <file1>
   git commit -m "First part of split commit"
   git add <file2>
   git commit -m "Second part of split commit"
   ```
4. Continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### Removing a Commit
Use interactive rebase and change `pick` to `drop` for the commit you want to remove.

### Rewriting Author Information
To change the author for the last commit:
```bash
git commit --amend --author="New Author Name <email@address.com>"
```

For multiple commits, use `git filter-branch`.

## 11. Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive. They reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository.

### Common Hooks:
- `pre-commit`: Run before a commit is created
- `prepare-commit-msg`: Run before the commit message editor is fired up
- `commit-msg`: Validate commit messages
- `post-commit`: Run after a commit is created
- `pre-push`: Run before a push is executed

### Example: pre-commit Hook for Running Tests
Create a file `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm test

# $? stores exit value of the last command
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
 echo "Tests must pass before commit!"
 exit 1
fi
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## 12. Troubleshooting and Recovery

### Undoing Changes
Discard changes in working directory:
```bash
git checkout -- <file>
```

Unstage a file:
```bash
git reset HEAD <file>
```

### Recovering Lost Commits
View reflog:
```bash
git reflog
```

Restore to a specific commit:
```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

### Debugging with Bisect
Start the bisect process:
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad  # Current version is bad
git bisect good <commit-hash>  # Last known good commit
```

Git will checkout commits between the good and bad commit. Test your code and mark each commit:
```bash
git bisect good  # or git bisect bad
```

When finished:
```bash
git bisect reset
```

## 13. Git Best Practices

1. Write good commit messages
2. Commit early and often
3. Don't alter published history
4. Use branches
5. Agree on a workflow
6. Don't commit generated files
7. Use .gitignore
8. Keep your repositories lean
9. Regularly fetch and rebase
10. Use tags for releases

## 14. Advanced Git Configurations

### Aliases
Create shortcuts for common commands:
```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
```

### Auto-correct
Enable Git's auto-correct feature:
```bash
git config --global help.autocorrect 1
```

### Credential Helper
Cache your credentials:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

### Color UI
Enable colored output:
```bash
git config --global color.ui auto
```

## 15. Git Workflows for Different Team Sizes

### Solo Developer
- Use feature branches
- Commit often
- Push regularly to a remote repository for backup

### Small Team (2-5 developers)
- Use feature branches
- Pull requests for code review
- Merge to main after review

### Medium Team (5-20 developers)
- Gitflow or GitHub flow
- Continuous Integration
- Code review process
- Release branches

### Large Team (20+ developers)
- Trunk-based development
- Heavy use of feature flags
- Automated testing and CI/CD
- Multiple maintainers

## 16. Integrating Git with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions
1. Create `.github/workflows/main.yml`
2. Define your workflow:
   ```yaml
   name: CI
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Run tests
         run: |
           npm install
           npm test
   ```



### GitLab CI/CD
1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repository root:
   ```yaml
   stages:
     - build
     - test
     - deploy

   build-job:
     stage: build
     script:
       - echo "Compiling the code..."
       - mkdir build
       - touch build/info.txt

   test-job:
     stage: test
     script:
       - echo "Running tests..."
       - test -f "build/info.txt"

   deploy-job:
     stage: deploy
     script:
       - echo "Deploying application..."
       - echo "Application successfully deployed."
   ```

2. GitLab will automatically detect and run this pipeline for each commit.

### Jenkins
1. Create a `Jenkinsfile` in your repository root:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm install'
               }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm test'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm run deploy'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. Set up a Jenkins job to use this Jenkinsfile for your repository.

## 17. Git Performance Optimization

### Improving Clone and Fetch Speed
1. Shallow clone:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 <repository-url>
   ```
   This clones only the latest commit.

2. Single branch clone:
   ```bash
   git clone --single-branch --branch <branch-name> <repository-url>
   ```

3. Partial clone:
   ```bash
   git clone --filter=blob:none <repository-url>
   ```
   This excludes file contents from the initial clone.

### Speeding Up Git Operations
1. Enable Git's built-in garbage collection:
   ```bash
   git gc
   ```

2. Prune unnecessary objects:
   ```bash
   git prune
   ```

3. Use `git fetch --all` instead of multiple `git fetch origin`.

4. Use `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` to avoid unnecessary merge commits.

### Optimizing Large Repositories
1. Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for large files:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.psd"
   ```

2. Use sparse-checkout for monorepos:
   ```bash
   git clone --no-checkout <repository-url>
   cd <repository>
   git sparse-checkout init --cone
   git sparse-checkout set <path1> <path2>
   ```

3. Use Git worktrees for working on multiple branches simultaneously:
   ```bash
   git worktree add -b feature-branch ../feature-branch main
   ```

## 18. Advanced Git Commands and Techniques

### Reflog: Your Safety Net
Git reflog is a mechanism to record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.

View reflog:
```bash
git reflog
```

Restore to a specific reflog entry:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
```

### Git Stash
Stash changes:
```bash
git stash
```

List stashes:
```bash
git stash list
```

Apply a stash:
```bash
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

Create a branch from a stash:
```bash
git stash branch <branch-name> stash@{0}
```

### Git Blame
See who last modified each line of a file:
```bash
git blame <file>
```

### Git Cherry
See which commits have been cherry-picked:
```bash
git cherry main feature-branch
```

### Git Worktree
Create a new worktree:
```bash
git worktree add -b emergency-fix ../temp main
```

List worktrees:
```bash
git worktree list
```

Remove a worktree:
```bash
git worktree remove ../temp
```

### Git Bundle
Create a bundle:
```bash
git bundle create repo.bundle HEAD main
```

Clone from a bundle:
```bash
git clone repo.bundle repo
```

### Git Notes
Add a note:
```bash
git notes add -m "This is a note" <commit-hash>
```

Show notes:
```bash
git log --show-notes
```

## 19. Git Internals Deep Dive

### Git Objects
1. Blob: Stores file content
2. Tree: Represents a directory structure
3. Commit: Represents a specific point in history
4. Tag: Points to a specific commit (usually used for release versions)

View the contents of a Git object:
```bash
git cat-file -p <object-hash>
```

### Git References
References are pointers to commits. They include:
- HEAD: Points to the current commit/branch
- Branches: Mutable pointers to commits
- Tags: Immutable pointers to specific commits

View the commit a reference is pointing to:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse main
git rev-parse v1.0
```

### The Git Index
The index (or staging area) is a binary file in the `.git` directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit.

View the contents of the index:
```bash
git ls-files --stage
```

### Packfiles
Git uses packfiles to store objects efficiently, especially for network operations.

Create a packfile:
```bash
git gc
```

View packfile contents:
```bash
git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-*.idx
```

### The Refspec
A refspec maps references in a remote repository to references in your local repository.

Push a branch using a refspec:
```bash
git push origin src/main:dst/main
```

Fetch a branch using a refspec:
```bash
git fetch origin +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```
